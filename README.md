# AlojDraw

This is my final project.
Online at <http://alodraw.herokuapp.com>!

A lot of the time I spent on this was perfecting it, namely perfecting the image displaying and then the chunk loading.

I didn't add the feature of having to wait before placing another pixel, and I don't mind it like that.
I might add this in the future.
